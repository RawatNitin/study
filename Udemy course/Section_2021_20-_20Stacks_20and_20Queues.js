// 1. Arrays work as stacks:
//     a) Use PUSH and POP methods
//                  OR
//     b) Use UNSHIFT and SHIFT methods

// 2. Singly Linked List can be used to make stack. Achieve LIFO as we add to the begining and remove from begining.:
//     a) Use SHIFT method of SLL to remove from the begining of SLL instead of POP method of SLL, because the time complexity should be constant and incase of SLL-POP time complexity is O(n);
//     b) USE UNSHIFT method of SLL to add to the begining of SLL

//  First IN first OUT
// 1. Arrays work as QUEUES:
//     a) Use PUSH and SHIFT methods
//                 OR
//     b) Use UNSHIFT and POP methods

// 2. Singly Linked List can be used to make stack. Achieve FIFO as we add to the tail and remove from begining.:
//     a) Use SHIFT method of SLL to remove from the begining of SLL instead of POP method of SLL, because the time complexity should be constant and incase of SLL-POP time complexity is O(n);
//     b) USE PUSH method of SLL to add to the end of SLL
